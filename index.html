        About me
    </div>
        <p> I'm 20 and my nickname Era. I'm student Ala-Too International University. I was born on January 17,2002. 
            When I was in school I wanted to become a doctor, but due to the fact that I didn't have enough points, I didn't enter the doctor.  
            That's the reason why i study in Ala-Too University.</p>
